**A group of pirates created their own language which is different from normal English. English is translated to the Pirate Language by taking the initial letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and then adding 'arg'.**

### Write a program that takes a string as an input and prints the translated text to the language of pirates.

Example:

Sample Input 1:
Take what you can, give nothing back.

Sample Output 1:
akeTarg hatwarg ouyarg ancarg, ivegarg othingnarg ackbarg.

Notes:
- punctuation should remain at the end. (.,;?!)
- there could be multiple punctiation. Like "Yes!!"
